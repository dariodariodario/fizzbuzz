# fizzbuzz
## My attempt at a proper fizzbuzz implementation in Java TDD.

The fizzbuzz problem:

given a number n, output a string where numbers are rendered as decimals or:

- if multiple of 3 as fizz
- if multiple of 5 as buzz
- if multiple of 3 and 5 as fizzbuzz

This test is of simple implementation, but it is hard to test it rigorously with TDD. This is my solution.
